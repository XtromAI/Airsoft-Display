# Archive - Historical Documentation

This folder contains archived documentation from the development process that is no longer actively used but preserved for historical reference.

## What's Archived Here

### Display Library Research (August 2025)

During initial development, extensive research was conducted on using third-party display libraries (U8g2, Adafruit) for the SH1107 OLED display. After multiple integration attempts failed to produce a working display (only noise/static), the decision was made to write a custom driver instead.

**Files:**
- `display-driver-research.md` (427 lines) - U8g2 integration research and implementation guide
- `display-library-comparison.md` (226 lines) - Comparative analysis of display library options

**Timeline:**
- Aug 3, 2025: U8g2 library integration attempt
- Aug 4, 2025 (8:53 PM): Final troubleshooting, created research docs
- Aug 4, 2025 (9:17 PM): Custom driver working successfully

### Font Implementation Decision (August 2025)

Similar to the display driver, attempts to use U8g2's compressed font format proved too complex. A custom row-major bitmap font format was created instead.

**Files:**
- `2025-08-05-FONT-DECISION.md` - Why custom font format was chosen over U8g2 fonts

**Timeline:**
- Aug 5, 2025: Attempted U8g2 font integration
- Aug 6, 2025: Custom 8x8 bitmap font implemented
- Aug 6-7, 2025: Added 16x16 font and font management

## Why Archive These?

These documents represent:
1. **Engineering Journey** - The troubleshooting and decision-making process
2. **Due Diligence** - Extensive research was done before abandoning third-party libraries
3. **Learning Experience** - Valuable insights about library integration challenges
4. **Future Reference** - Context for why a custom driver was chosen

## Current Implementation

The project now uses a **custom SH1107 driver** located in `lib/sh1107-pico/` which:
- Works reliably (unlike the U8g2 attempts)
- Is optimized specifically for this project
- Is based on proven MicroPython reference code
- Requires no external library dependencies

See `lib/sh1107-pico/docs/` for current driver documentation.
